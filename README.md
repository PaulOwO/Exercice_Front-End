### Feedback

Trying out a new language was a lot of fun.
One of the difficulties I had was the quantity of frameworks, which made looking for answers and documentation online a hassle at the start, but after understanding what each framework does, looking for answers was easier.
I appreciated the workflow very much thanks to web development's fast feedback.
I'm happy with the pace I learned at, and I also enjoyed trying new things.
